        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The Unicorn is truly a breath-taking animal as those lucky enough to have encountered one would tell you. It is taller than an average horse, eventually reaching the height of around two peds when fully grown. Its ragged yet magnificent mane and tail is always a translucent silver colour, which can shine so bright under the sun that it can be dangerous to look directly at the beast. The coat of a Unicorn can be in a range of colours, spanning through dark brown, jet-black, moonlight silver, dazzling gold, although commonly it is seen to be pure white.</p>
        <h2>How a unicorn breathes?</h2>
        <p>A unicorn breathes rainbows like a dragon breathes fire.</p>
        <h2>How long does a unicorn live?</h2>
        <p>The Unicorn is truly a breath-taking animal as those lucky enough to have encountered one would tell you. It is taller than an average horse. It lives forever until you kill it for its magical properties.</p>
