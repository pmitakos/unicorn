<h1>Scientific Classification/h1>
<p>
	Unicorn (Latin: ūnicornis; "one-horned") is a mythological animal resembling a white horse with a single horn growing out of its forehead[1]. In some accounts they also have features belonging to other hoofed animals such as deer and goats, eg the picture on the right shows a unicorn with a goat's beard. They have been depicted in art and heraldry since 3000 BC in places as far apart as Mesopotamia, China, India, and southern Europe, and they are in fact the national animal of Scotland.

Unicorn, mythological animal resembling a horse or a kid with a single horn on its forehead. The unicorn appeared in early Mesopotamian artworks, and it also was referred to in the ancient myths of India and China. The earliest description in Greek literature of a single-horned (Greek monokerōs, Latin unicornis) animal was by the historian Ctesias (c. 400 bce), who related that the Indian wild ass was the size of a horse, with a white body, purple head, and blue eyes, and on its forehead was a cubit-long horn coloured red at the pointed tip, black in the middle, and white at the base. Those who drank from its horn were thought to be protected from stomach trouble, epilepsy, and poison. It was very fleet of foot and difficult to capture. The actual animal behind Ctesias’s description was probably the Indian rhinoceros.

<h1>Subspecies</h1>
<p>
The unicorn has a wide range of appearances, depending on the subspecies. For example, the Chinese unicorn is shaped like a large stag, having a mane, cloven hooves, and multi-colored skin. This variant has a musical, bell-like call. The Indian unicorn is large and white, resembling a wild ass, with a red head and dark blue eyes. Julius Caesar described the European unicorn as resembling a deer, while later accounts from the Middle Ages depicted the unicorn as more of a goat-like creature, with a tail similar to that of a lion. The unicorns most familiar to modern eyes are descendants of the European unicorn, and are larger, with white horse-like bodies. All subspecies of unicorn have a single horn, generally long and spiraled, protruding from the forehead. While the color of this horn varies depending on the subspecies, white or black horns are the most common.

 The narwhal was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae.[3] Its name is derived from the Old Norse word nár, meaning "corpse", in reference to the animal's greyish, mottled pigmentation, like that of a drowned sailor[4] and its summer-time habit of lying still at or near the surface of the sea (called "logging").[5] The scientific name, Monodon monoceros, is derived from the Greek: "one-tooth one-horn".[4]

	Abada :Abadas are extremely similar to unicorns. The abada has two crooked horns, opposed to a unicorn's single horn. The abada's horns can act as an antidote to poison. It has been described as being the size of a small donkey with the tail of a boar. They are all herbivores. It also goes by the name of Nillekma or Arase. It is said to be native to Kurdufan, a former province of central Sudan, but was first discovered in Central Africa. It is also sometimes said to breathe fire and ice.
